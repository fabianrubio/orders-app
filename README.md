Next.js: A popular React framework that provides server-side rendering and other features to build scalable applications.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI (Mui): A popular React UI framework that provides a set of pre-built components and styling options.
Yup: A JavaScript schema validation library that helps validate form input data.
Formik: A React library for building forms and managing form state.
Axios: A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.
npm: A package manager for Node.js that is used to install and manage the project dependencies.

## Environment Variables
